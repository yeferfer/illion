              Take this chance to do what few in human history have ever done:
              determine the fundamental structure of a new society. The founders
              of Ilion will create and control their own government, not the
              other way around. It’s a truly unique opportunity to create laws,
              regulations, and taxes specifically designed to generate healthy
              growth and wealth.
